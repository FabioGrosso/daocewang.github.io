## Biography
I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at Indiana University, Bloomington, expect to graduate in May 2025. I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018, and a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Florida in 2020. I did summer research intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
My Ph.D. research focuses on designing efficient data reduction approaches for extreme-scale scientific simulations on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
